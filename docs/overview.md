# Contributor Guide overview

SMA Technologies products are migrating their help content to be open source!  The majority of the <https://help.smatechnologies.com> website will now have its content hosted on GitHub on our organizational page [here](https://github.com/smatechnologies).  The objective is to provide more relevant, higher quality content that consumers of the products find useful.  Open-sourcing the help content will allow individuals outside of SMA Technologies Product and Engineering teams to contribute!

## GitHub account

All contributions require users to have a GitHub account.  [Join GitHub](https://github.com/join) to create an account and begin contributing!

:::note
SMA Technologies employees need to join the **[smatechnologies](https://github.com/smatechnologies)** organization.
